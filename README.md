## Diabetic And Heart Disease Prediction System WebApp Using Machine Learning 
Diabetic and Heart Disease prediction system using Machine Learning 
An analysis project for predicting the Diabetic and Heart Disease by the help of the trained Machine Learning Model. That 
takes different inputs from the user and the trained model predict the result on the basic of the data. It involves building a 
Support Vector Machine model for the Diabetic Prediction, and we use Logistic Regression model for Heart Disease 
prediction. Python, Streamlit for Deployment.
