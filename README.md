## Diabetic And Heart Disease Prediction System WebApp Using Machine Learning [Link](https://isinghabhishek-diseases-prediction-ml-model-mdps-public-pyigt8.streamlitapp.com/) 

- An analysis project for predicting the Diabetic and Heart Disease by the help of the trained Machine Learning Model. 
- That takes different inputs from the user and the trained model predict the result on the basic of the data. 
- It involves building a Support Vector Machine model for the Diabetic Prediction, and we use Logistic Regression model for Heart Disease prediction. 
- Achieved accuracy of 80.55% to predict Diabetic and 82.48% accuracy for Heart Disease ML model.
- Machine Learning Using Python, Spyder, Github and Streamlit for Deployment of Web App.
